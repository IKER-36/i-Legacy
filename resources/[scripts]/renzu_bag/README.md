- Persistents Objects and State Bags. upon script restart or server restart ( this is like a real stash ) this is tested in 2699 BUILD (objects are persistent even without any player)
- Easy to Add and Modify new model/bag in config
Description
- this script create or emulate stash logic to your item when its used. its unique to its Serial Number
- my original plan for item based stash is the ox container, but there seems no way to Create new item container from other resource yet as for now. (or educate me, its faster if container is used but there will no probably a prop when its dropped. will use the ox drop system logic)

# Dependency
- ESX Framework
- Ox_inventory
- Ox_lib

# to be update
- item blacklisting - its not supported by ox yet. so the bag can be puted to another bag too. only possible in containers.
- stash restrictions. like job etc.
